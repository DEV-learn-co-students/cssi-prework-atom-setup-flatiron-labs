# Atom Text Editor Setup

## Objectives

1. Download and set up the Atom text editor

## Instructions

The Learn.co Gem comes with a text editor called Sublime Text - it's a great program and you're welcome to use it, but the standard CSSI text editor is Atom (made by the folks at Github).

### Part 1: Download Atom

Head to [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) and click the "Download for Mac" button. Install Atom as you would any other application from the internet.

### Part 2: Open a file

If you want to open a file from the command line using the Atom, type: `open file_name -a Atom`. The `-a` flag designates a specific application (in this case Atom) as the application to open the file. 

Atom also automatically installs a "symlink" which allows you to open files without using the `-a` flag. Instead, you can just type `atom file_name` to open a file, or `atom .` to open the contents of your current working directory in Atom.

Get used to doing this, as you'll be opening files and folders in Atom a lot!!!
